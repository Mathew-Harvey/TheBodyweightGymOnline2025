# Getting Out of Your Comfort Zone

How do you get out of your comfort zone – or in other words, how do you keep growing?

**The answer: take the right direction and stay motivated.**

As human beings, we love seeing ourselves get better, achieve small victories, and create our own identity and success in life. However, you must know that to improve, you must initiate change. If you do not take action, then nothing will change for the better!

We often avoid change through the fear that this change will be for the worse. We tend to stay in our comfort zone as we know it as our safe place. We even are designed biologically to do the minimum, just to save up our energy! Ironically, our survival instinct makes us lazy.


So how do we get out of our comfort zone? Here’s a little tip. You may be familiar with Nike's slogan: Just do it. Well, the Just Do It campaign revolves around a powerful three-word combination that motivates us to succeed. 


It is a strong call to action. The campaign even allowed Nike to increase its share from millions to billions of dollars!


If you can act on this in the present moment, day after day, week after week, your thought process will be aligned with your actions.


As they say, Just do it. Just start small. It can be anything. 

Go for a yoga session in a park, 

Set an alarm to wake up early tomorrow to study that unit you struggle with,

Cook and eat a vegetable that you never had before tonight, 

Compliment a stranger in the street – I guarantee that you will make their day, and yours 

Ask yourself: when was the last time you did something for the first time?

I then have a little challenge for you. Do something that you have never done before that will put you out of your comfort zone. If you feel up to it, you can even post it on your social media with the hashtag #thebodyweightgym


Good luck!
