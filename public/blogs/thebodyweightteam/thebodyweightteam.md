I started The Bodyweight Gym to pursue an ideal: That everyone can develop themselves physically with simple equipment, the right education and support. I can not do this alone, I've been lucky enough to find three other amazing coaches to help support your growth and development. We coach from a position of integrity  - we only teach what we've personally experienced. This article, I'll introduce you to The Bodyweight Gym coaching team, give you a insight into who we are and how we can help you better.


Mat - Founder, Director and Coach

I took my first ever coaching job at the age of 15, for 20 years coaching has been a weekend hobby of passion. 5 years ago I left my corporate job with a clear vision - to help people move and feel better. Opening my own studio gym has given me the opportunity to work with larger groups of people.

I have a bachelor of science with a double major in human movement and marine science and a number of other qualifications around weightlifting, personal training and calisthenics. I advocate strength, mobility and quality over intensity (yes you'll still work very hard). I love skill development through balance and progressing hard bodyweight movements.
