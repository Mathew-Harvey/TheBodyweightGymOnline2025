## What is Creatine and How Does It Work? {#what-is-creatine}

![Diagram: ATP-PCr energy system in muscle cells](/blogs/suppliments/7232a3_6ae46569796f4d0ca23670a4af1377fa~mv2.avif)

### The Energy Currency of Your Muscles

Creatine isn't a steroid, hormone, or magical substance. It's a naturally occurring compound made from three amino acids: arginine, glycine, and methionine. Your body produces about 1-2 grams daily, and you get another 1-2 grams from dietary sources (primarily meat).

### The Phosphocreatine System Explained

```
ATP (energy) → ADP (depleted) + Energy for muscle contraction
Phosphocreatine → Creatine + Phosphate
Phosphate + ADP → ATP (energy restored!)
```

This system provides energy for:
- First 10-15 seconds of explosive activity
- Heavy lifts (1-5 reps)
- Sprints and jumps
- Quick muscle contractions

### Who Are "Responders" vs "Non-Responders"?

Research identifies clear characteristics:

**High Responders (30% of population):**
- Lower baseline creatine levels
- Higher Type II muscle fiber percentage (>60%)
- Greater muscle mass potential
- See 20-30% strength gains

**Moderate Responders (50% of population):**
- Average baseline levels
- Mixed fiber type
- See 10-20% strength gains

**Low/Non-Responders (20% of population):**
- Already high baseline creatine
- Higher Type I fiber percentage
- May see <5% improvement
- Often endurance athletes

## Dosing Strategies That Work {#dosing}

![Chart: Loading vs maintenance dosing protocols](/blogs/suppliments/7232a3_a2a7ad48bb13447481ee84473686e90b~mv2.avif)

### Option 1: Fast Loading Protocol (5-7 Days)

**Best For:** Quick results, competition preparation

```
Loading Phase (Days 1-7):
- Dose: 0.3g per kg bodyweight
- Split into 4 equal doses
- Take with meals
- Example (70kg person): 21g daily = 5g x 4 times

Maintenance Phase (Day 8+):
- Dose: 0.03-0.05g per kg bodyweight
- Single daily dose
- Example: 3-5g daily
```

### Option 2: Slow Loading Protocol (28 Days)

**Best For:** Sensitive stomachs, gradual adaptation

```
Consistent Daily Dose:
- 3-5g per day
- Single dose
- Same saturation as fast loading
- Less GI distress risk
```

### Option 3: Cycling Protocol (Advanced)

**For Experienced Users:**

```
8 Weeks On:
- Standard maintenance dose
- Track performance metrics

4 Weeks Off:
- Allow natural production recovery
- Assess baseline performance

Repeat Cycle
```

### Timing Considerations

**Recent Research Shows:**
- Post-workout may be slightly superior
- With carbs/protein enhances uptake
- Consistency matters more than timing
- Split dosing reduces GI issues

### Dosing Calculator

| Body Weight | Loading Dose (Daily) | Maintenance Dose |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 50kg (110lb) | 15g (3g x 5) | 2.5-3g |
| 60kg (132lb) | 18g (4.5g x 4) | 3-4g |
| 70kg (154lb) | 21g (5g x 4) | 3.5-5g |
| 80kg (176lb) | 24g (6g x 4) | 4-5g |
| 90kg (198lb) | 27g (7g x 4) | 4.5-6g |
| 100kg (220lb) | 30g (7.5g x 4) | 5-7g |

## Common Questions Answered {#faq}

### Q: Will I lose my gains if I stop taking creatine?

**A:** You'll lose the water weight (2-4 lbs) within 4 weeks. Strength gains from training remain, but performance may decrease 5-10% as creatine stores deplete.

### Q: Can I take creatine while cutting?

**A:** Absolutely. Creatine helps preserve strength and muscle mass during caloric deficit. The water weight is intramuscular, not subcutaneous fat.

### Q: Does caffeine cancel out creatine?

**A:** Recent research shows no interaction with normal caffeine intake (<400mg daily). The original study suggesting interference was flawed.

### Q: Should I take creatine on rest days?

**A:** Yes. Maintaining saturation requires daily intake. Muscle creatine stores deplete slowly (4-6 weeks).

### Q: Can creatine cause hair loss?

**A:** One small study showed increased DHT, but no actual hair loss was measured. No subsequent studies have confirmed this link. If genetically predisposed to male pattern baldness, monitor and discontinue if concerned.

### Q: Is creatine a steroid?

**A:** No. Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in food. It doesn't affect hormones like steroids do. It's legal in all sports and competitions.

### Q: Do I need to cycle creatine?

**A:** No evidence suggests cycling is necessary. Long-term studies show safety with continuous use. Some choose to cycle for personal preference.

### Q: What happens if I miss a dose?

**A:** Missing one dose won't affect saturation. Missing several days may slightly reduce stores. Simply resume normal dosing.
